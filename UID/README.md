## 📌 Project Overview
 
The E-Commerce Fashion Website is a fully responsive, aesthetically modern shopping platform built using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
We developed this project as part of our User Interface Design (UID) coursework to simulate a real-world development environment. The objective was to build an intuitive shopping experience for users while learning web design principles, UI/UX best practices, and responsive frontend development.
 
Throughout the project, we focused on:
 
User-Centric Design: Creating clean layouts, logical navigation, and smooth interactions.
 
Collaborative Development: Working as a team to design, code, and test across different modules.
 
Interactive Experience: Enhancing user engagement with a custom chatbot — KrizBot.
 
Storytelling Through UI: Documenting our project milestones and journey in a blog format within the site.
 
Real-World Simulation: Managing GitHub version control, mobile-first design, and project deadlines.
 
This project not only helped us grow as developers but also as a team, understanding the value of coordination, creativity, and delivering quality code.
